# Logging

The logging process has the purpose to save our detail process during the experiment. In this codebase, we use custom code for saving the model and also use [Tensorboard](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html) for PyTorch for saving the model graph and static values of loss/error from training and validation.
