This repository containing source code and documentation in the process of the visual storytelling task development. Visual storytelling is a task transforming a sequence of images into a coherent story. Different from another image-to-text task such as image captioning, the visual storytelling task has a special challenge due to the nature of the story generated not only describe the literal object in image representation but also non-visual concept should appear in text generated story. 

This codebase including both source code written in Python and also documentation for each step. Included in this repository:
1. [Downloading the dataset](https://github.com/systems-ai-lab/visualstorytelling-codebase/blob/master/documentation/downloading-the-dataset.md)
2. [Generating the text vocabulary](https://github.com/systems-ai-lab/visualstorytelling-codebase/blob/master/documentation/generating-text-vocabulary.md)
